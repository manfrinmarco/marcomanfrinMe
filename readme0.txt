Project Description: Personal Portfolio Website

Create a responsive Personal Portfolio Website that showcases your skills, experiences, and personality. 
The project will focus on front-end development techniques, providing hands-on experience in building a 
professional-looking and user-friendly website.

Objectives:
• Design a clean and modern layout that adjusts seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using responsive web design principles.
• Highlight your career journey, including your resume, skills, projects, and personal interests, to simulate a professional web presence.
• Utilize HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
• Optionally, incorporate a contact form for visitors to reach out (no back-end processing required).

Key Features:
1. Home Section: A welcoming page with your photo, name, and a tagline (e.g., “Aspiring Web Developer”).
2. About Section: An overview of your background, career objectives, and a brief biography.
3. Resume Section: A detailed section showcasing your education, work experience, and skills (use a table or cards).
4. Contact Section: Provide links to your social profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub) and an optional form to capture visitor messages, with all the required validation.

Learning Outcomes:
• Apply responsive design techniques with media queries and a mobile-first approach.
• Use CSS Grid (or Flexbox) for layout and alignment.
• Enhance user experience with basic JavaScript interactivity (e.g., smooth scrolling, collapsible menus).
• Implement best practices for web accessibility and SEO basics (like proper use of headings, alt text for images, and meta tags).
